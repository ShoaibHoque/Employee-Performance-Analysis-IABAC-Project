    "# Project Summary by Shoaib Hoque\n",
    "The Data science project which is given here is an analysis of employee performance form INX Furture Inc. The project goal is to find the performance rating of the employees from each feature of their data such as total work experience, gender, department, current role..etc. The Goal and Insights of the project as follows,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Department wise performances\n",
    "2. Top 3 Important Factors affecting employee performance\n",
    "3. A trained model which can predict the employee performance based on factors as inputs. This will be used to hire employees\n",
    "4. Recommendations to improve the employee performance based on insights from analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The given data of employees has the 1200 data to perform a higher level machine learning where it is well structured. The features present in the data are 28 in total. The Shape of the data is 1200x28. The 28 features are classified into quantitative and qualitative where 16 features are qualitative and 11 features are quantitative. The employee ID data is alphanumerical data which doesn't play a role as a relevant feature for performance rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is a complete labelled data and categorical which decides the machine learning algorithm to be used. The important aspects of the data are depending on the correlation of data between features and performance rating. The analysis of the project has gone through the stage of distribution analysis, correlation analysis and analysis by each department to satisfy the project goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning model which is used in this project is random forest classifier at which predicted the nearby higher accuracy of 93%. Since it is categorical labelled data, it has to go through the classifier machine learning techniques which will be suitable for this structured data. The numerical features are the most relevant in the model according to correlation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the goals of this project is to find the important feature affecting the performance rating. The important features were predicted using the machine learning model feature importance technique. The main technique used in the preprocessing data using the one hot encoding method to convert the string-categorical data into numerical data, because, the most of machine learning methods are based on numerical methods where strings are not supportive. The overall project was performed and achieved the goals by using the machine learning model and visualization techniques.\n"

    "- Experience years at this company: Employees who have been with this company for more than 5 years tend to demonstrate outstanding performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusions from Department vs. Performance Rating**\n",
    "- **31%** of employees from the **Sales department**, **30%** from the **Development department**, and **28%** from the **Research & Development department**, followed by **4%** from **HR and Finance**, and **1.6% from Data Science**\n",
    "\n",
    "- According to the data analysis, **72%** of employees were rated as having **excellent performance**, **16%** were rated as having **good performance**, and **11% had outstanding performance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall Development and **Research & Development department performance** was **higher** than other departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the **Finance and HR Departments**, employees with **less than 2 years** of experience, including freshers, tend to have **lower performance levels**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the **Sales, R&D, and Development departments**, employees with **over 15 years of experience have not performed well**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The analysis indicates that as the **salary hike percentage increases, employee performance also increases.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The analysis further shows that as the level of **employee environment satisfaction increases, employee performance also improves.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Employees who have recently received promotions demonstrate excellent performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Top 3 Important Factors effecting employee performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform feature importance analysis to identify the top three factors influencing employee performance\n",
    "- Use statistical and machine learning techniques to uncover hidden patterns and relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Top 3 Features Affecting Employee Performance:\n",
    "1. **EmpLastSalaryHikePercent**: 0.23308086340231407\n",
    "2. **EmpEnvironmentSatisfaction**: 0.212738558804534\n",
    "3. **YearsSinceLastPromotion**: 0.18997657371764842\n",
    "\n",
    "These Factors show the highest correlation and association with the Performance Rating of the employees. which means that any change in these factors will largly impact the performance of an employee\n",
    "\n",
    "EnvironmentSatisfaction and EmpLastSalaryHikePercent are positively correlated to the Performance Rating of an employee, i.e. a hike or drop in one would lead to a hike or drop in the performance rating respectively. on the other hand YearsSinceLastPromotion an performance rating are negatively coerrlated i.e. they have an inverse relation.\n",

    "#### Why to Choose Random Forest model \n",
    "Choosing specific models for feature importance analysis depends on various factors such as the nature of the data, interpretability, and the trade-off between accuracy and complexity. Here's a brief explanation of why Random Forest commonly used for feature importance analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensemble Method: Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It's known for its robustness and ability to handle a variety of data types.\n",
    "- Feature Importance: Random Forest provides a straightforward way to calculate feature importance based on how much each feature improves the purity (or information gain) of the trees in the forest.\n",
    "- Stability: Random Forest tends to be less prone to overfitting and is stable across different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. A trained model which can predict the employee performance**\n",
    "Here I've tried to compare the 7 models I've trained before in \"train_model\" with test data stored in \"data_processing\" sector for getting maximum accuracy final model to predict employees performances which can help to hire new employees in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "From predicting with multiple models I've got \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models** are giving maximum accuracy level with **93.75% and 92.92%**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Naive Bayes** is producing **lowest accuracy** score with **74.58%**\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression and SVM** models are producing moderate level accuracy among others with **85% and 84.17%**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we see training and validation comparisons, we can clearly see **Random Forest is doing best prediction at their actual test data compared to validation data during their period.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we'll take **Random Forest**  model which can predict the employee performance based on factors as inputs. This will be used to hire employees\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Recommendations to improve the employee performance**\n",
    "- Develop personalized training modules based on employees' experience levels.\n",
    "- Ensure competitive compensation, especially for those with hourly rates above 85.\n",
    "- Facilitate quicker promotions within 4 years to boost motivation.\n",
    "- Offer flexible work arrangements to employees living within 10 km of the office.\n",
    "- Address performance disparities in Sales and R&D through targeted initiatives.\n",
    "- Tailor support for employees in Life Science, Medicine, and Marketing.\n",
    "- The company should provide a better environment as it increases the performance drastically.\n",
    "- The company should increase the salary of the employee from time to time and help them maintain a worklife balance.\n",
    "- On the other hand, shuffling the manager from time to time will also affect performance\n",
    "- The salary hike will give the boost to the employees to perform well.\n",
    "- Promote the employee ervery 6th month\n",
    "- Improve Employee's work-life balance this affects the performance rating.\n",
    "- Implement an employee recognition and rewards system that acknowledges and motivates \"High Performers.\" This could include bonuses, promotions, or special incentives to maintain their high performance levels.\n",
    "- Address attrition concerns by understanding the reasons for employee turnover.Take necessary steps to retain top-performing employees and create a supportive work culture.\n",
    "- Recognize and appreciate employees' efforts and achievements. Acknowledging their hard work boosts motivation and encourages them to excel further.\n",
    "- Implement a performance-based incentive system to motivate employees. Recognizing and rewarding high-performing employees can boost their morale and encourage others to improve their performance.\n"
